Hi guys,

I hope you're doing well.

I am gutted by the lack of attendance in our previous CLDV session, anyway I wanted to take you guys through Entity Relationships in EF Core, to help you guys develop cleaner and efficient solutions without
have to create 'ViewModels' which complicates.

Moreover the code I have shared with you guys entails the use of EF Core for Entity Relationships(One-to-One multiplicity), hopefully next week we will cover One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationships.

TO RUN ME, DO THIS!!!!!
  * Delete the Migrations folder
  * Make changes to the Connection String i.e the name of the Server to match your machine's SQL Server name
  * Add a new Migration and update the database
  * That's it, you're slowly becoming a ASP.NET Core guru, I am super proud of you :)

One Love!
