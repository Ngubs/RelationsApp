Hi guys,

I hope you're doing well.

I am gutted by the lack of attendance in our previous CLDV session, anyway I wanted to take you guys through Entity Relationships in EF Core, to help you guys develop cleaner and efficient solutions without
have to create 'ViewModels' which complicates.

Moreover the code I have shared with you guys entails the use of EF Core for Entity Relationships(One-to-One multiplicity), hopefully next week we will cover One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationships.

One Love!
