Hi guys,

I hope you're doing well.

I am gutted by the lack of attendance in our previous CLDV session, anyway I wanted to take you guys through Entity Relationships in EF Core, to help you guys develop cleaner and efficient solutions without
having to create 'ViewModels' which complicates your solutions, which is by the way out of whack!

Moreover the code I have shared with you guys entails the use of EF Core for Entity Relationships(One-to-One multiplicity), hopefully next week we will cover One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationships. I have also tried my level best to add as many comments as I could to make the code easy to read.

TO RUN ME, DO THIS!!!!!
  * Delete the Migrations folder
  * Make changes to the Connection String i.e change the name of the Server to match your machine's SQL Server name
  * Add a new Migration and update the database
  * That's it, you're slowly becoming a ASP.NET Core MVC guru, I am super proud of you :)

One Love!
